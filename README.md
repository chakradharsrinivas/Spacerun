_A Game for fighter Pilots_</br>

### Annet
1. This is a game designed in _JAVA_ using _JAVAFX_ and _Swing_ some graphical content included to look more realstic.
2. The above repository contains all the code files and one can find the assests used like _IMAGES, SVG, ICONS etc..._ from assests folder in the same.
3. I have also uploaded the executable _JAR_ file so that one can build and compile at their end with out any issues.
4. We also have generated an .exe file from the JAR file using additional libraires through which one can share that with any person.
